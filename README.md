# Features

This is a fork of leafvmaple's Octave Language extension, [also available in GitHub](https://github.com/leafvmaple/vscode-octave), which is no longer being supported.

This extension keeps the Octave terminal open so you can mess around after executing a script. 

## Keybinds
This are the defaults. You can modify them.
| Command           | Keybind                | Comment              |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `octave.run`      | `Ctrl + Enter`         | Run current document |
| `octave.runLines` | `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` | Run current line     |


## Release Notes
