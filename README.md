# Features

This is a fork of leafvmaple's Octave Language extension, [also available in GitHub](https://github.com/leafvmaple/vscode-octave), which is no longer being supported.

This extension keeps the Octave terminal open so you can mess around after executing a script. 

## Keybinds
This are the defaults. You can modify them.
| Command           | Keybind                | Comment              |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `octave.run`      | `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` | Run current document |
| `octave.runLines` | `Ctrl + Enter`         | Run current line     |


## Setup Guide

### Windows

1. Install Octave. Take note of the installation directory. For example, in `C:\Octave\Octave-7.1.0\`
2. Add `C:\Octave\Octave-7.1.0\mingw64\bin` (that is, add to the Octave installation path you noted before `\mingw64\bin` to the end) to your system's PATH environment variable.
3. Install the extension.
